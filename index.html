        <h1>Privacy Policy for Love Messages</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 26, 2025</p>
        <p>JoshTechApps ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your information when you use our mobile application, <strong>Love Messages</strong> (the "App"). The App provides a platform for users to browse, create, and share romantic messages, quotes, and images.</p>

        <div class="data-flow">
            <h3>ðŸ“Š Data Flow Transparency</h3>
            <p><strong>Our Role:</strong> We enable third-party services that may collect anonymized data</p>
            <p><strong>Their Role:</strong> Third-party services independently collect and process device data</p>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or process device data on our servers - this is handled directly by our partners according to their privacy policies.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Processing Overview</h2>
        <p>The following describes how data is processed when you use the App:</p>
        
        <h3>a. User-Generated Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Messages & Quotes</strong>: The App allows you to create and save custom love messages and quotes. These messages are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers unless you choose to share them.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: If you submit feedback through the App, we may receive your email address and feedback content when you choose to submit via email.</li>
            <li><strong>Photos and Media</strong>: If you use the camera feature or upload images for custom backgrounds, these images are stored locally on your device and are not sent to our servers unless you share them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Third-Party Data Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics Services</strong>: Our app uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics">Firebase Analytics</a> which may collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App. This includes information such as which features you use, session duration, and navigation patterns. This data does not identify you personally and is used to improve the App's performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reporting Services</strong>: Our app uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a> which may collect anonymized data about app crashes and performance issues. This may include device information and crash logs to help diagnose and fix issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Services</strong>: The App uses <a href="https://www.google.com/admob/">Google AdMob</a>, <a href="https://unity.com/ads">Unity Ads</a>, and <a href="https://vungle.com/">Vungle</a> to display ads. These advertising services independently collect anonymized data, such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, and general location data, to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. App Permissions</h3>

            <li><strong>Internet</strong>: Required for displaying ads, sending feedback, and analytics services.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Used to send daily love quote notifications (optional).</li>
        </ul>
