        <h1>Privacy Policy for Love Messages</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 20, 2025</p>
        <p>JoshTechApps ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, <strong>Love Messages</strong> (the "App"). The App provides a platform for users to browse, create, and share romantic messages, quotes, and images. Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information when you use the App:</p>
        
        <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content</strong>: The App allows you to create and save custom love messages and quotes. These messages are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers unless you choose to share them (e.g., via email, social media, or other sharing features).</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: If you submit feedback or seek help through the App (e.g., via the feedback or help forms), we may collect your email address and the content of your feedback. This information is sent to our support email (<a href="mailto:contactjoshtech@gmail.com">contactjoshtech@gmail.com</a>) when you choose to submit feedback via email.</li>
            <li><strong>Photos and Media</strong>: If you use the camera feature or upload images to customize backgrounds for quotes, the App accesses your device's camera or photo gallery. These images are stored locally on your device and are not sent to our servers unless you share them through the App's sharing features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics">Firebase Analytics</a> to collect anonymized data about how you interact with the App. This includes information such as which features you use (e.g., viewing categories, creating quotes), session duration, and navigation patterns. This data does not identify you personally and is used to improve the App's performance and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports</strong>: We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a> to collect anonymized data about app crashes and performance issues. This may include device information (e.g., device model, operating system version) and crash logs to help us diagnose and fix issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Data</strong>: The App uses <a href="https://www.google.com/admob/">Google AdMob</a> to display interstitial and native ads. AdMob may collect anonymized data, such as device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address, and general location data (inferred from IP address), to serve personalized or non-personalized ads based on your preferences. You can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads in your device settings, as described in <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2755998">Google’s Advertising Policies</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Permissions</h3>
        <p>The App requests the following permissions, which may involve accessing certain data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera</strong>: Used to take photos for custom quote backgrounds (optional, only if you enable this feature).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Read/Write External Storage)</strong>: Used to save or share images of quotes you create. This permission is only required for Android versions prior to Android 10.</li>
            <li><strong>Media (Read Media Images)</strong>: Used to access images from your gallery for custom backgrounds (Android 13 and above).</li>
            <li><strong>Internet and Network State</strong>: Required for displaying ads, sending feedback, and collecting analytics and crash reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Used to send daily love quote notifications (optional, enabled in the App’s settings). Notifications may include quotes from categories you select.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>d. Notification Data</h3>
        <p>If you enable notifications in the App’s settings, we use <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager">Android WorkManager</a> to schedule and deliver love quote notifications in the morning or evening of any day . These notifications are generated from a local JSON file (<code>LoveQuotes.json</code>) containing quotes and do not require server interaction. You can select preferred notification categories, which are stored locally in the App’s SharedPreferences.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Improve the App</strong>: Usage data and crash reports help us understand how the App is used and identify areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience</strong>: User-generated content (e.g., custom quotes) and settings (e.g., font, text size, color) are used to customize your experience within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>To Deliver Notifications</strong>: If enabled, we use your selected notification categories to send relevant love quotes.</li>
            <li><strong>To Display Ads</strong>: AdMob uses anonymized data to serve relevant ads, which support the App’s free availability.</li>
            <li><strong>To Respond to Feedback</strong>: If you submit feedback or help requests, we use your email address and feedback content to respond and provide support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share information in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong>: Usage data and crash reports are shared with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics">Firebase Analytics</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a> to analyze App performance. Firebase’s data practices are governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: Anonymized data (e.g., Advertising ID) is shared with AdMob to deliver ads. AdMob’s data practices are governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob Policies</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>User-Initiated Sharing</strong>: If you share quotes or images via email, social media, or other apps, the shared content is transmitted through the selected third-party app, which may have its own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: User-generated content (custom quotes, images) and settings (e.g., font, notification preferences) are stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences or local storage. This data is not transmitted to our servers unless you share it.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Storage</strong>: Analytics and crash data are processed by Firebase and stored on Google’s servers, as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. Ad-related data is processed by AdMob and stored on Google’s servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures</strong>: We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, such as secure coding practices and encryption for data transmitted to third-party services (e.g., Firebase, AdMob). However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permissions</strong>: You can deny or revoke permissions (e.g., camera, storage, notifications) in your device settings. Note that denying permissions may limit some App features.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable or disable notifications and select preferred categories in the App’s settings. Disabling notifications stops all scheduled notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device’s Advertising ID settings or disabling ad personalization in Google settings, as described in <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2755998">Google’s Advertising Policies</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: Since user-generated content is stored locally, you can delete it by clearing the App’s data or uninstalling the App. To clear data, go to your device’s settings, select Apps > Love Messages > Storage > Clear Data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contactjoshtech@gmail.com">contactjoshtech@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>The App may include links to third-party services, such as the Google Play Store for rating the App or sharing content via other apps (e.g., email, social media). These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. We encourage you to review their policies before sharing information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> (for Firebase and AdMob)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>8. International Users</h2>
        <p>The App is hosted and operated in the United States. If you use the App from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers or third-party service providers (e.g., Google) are located. By using the App, you consent to this transfer and processing, which may be subject to different data protection laws than in your country.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy or through in-app notifications. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
